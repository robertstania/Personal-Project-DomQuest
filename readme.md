### Stretch Goals:

 CSS Stretch goals:
 - Add a background image to the page that fits the theme.
 - Add a box around the header (like the one's that are on the cards).
 - Style the cards and buttons to fit the theme better.
 - Add visual effects for hovering over the button.

 JS Stretch goals:
 - Add a log below the cards that shows the 5 most recent quests you took.
 - Add a chance to fail the quest. For example "Small quest earns 10-20 gold and there's a 50% success rate".
 - In the log show if the quest was successful or not.
 - If the quest fails remove cash from the user.
 - Add additional animations.
